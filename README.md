# Hello, World! I'm Alise 👋🏽

My name is Alise Otilia Ramírez and I am an Afro-Latina on a mission to make tech (data) careers more accessible! I have a non-traditional background, but I think that gives me an edge in the interdisciplinary field of data science! I am on a journey of finding my place in data, and often share anecdotes of my personal experiences, advice, and inspiration for those transitioning into the field through blogs and tweets. I am open to projects, speaking gigs and mentorship.
